     *   commit at the next table version N.
     * - After TXN1 starts, another transaction TXN2 reads partition 'date=2021-09-07' and commits
     *   first at table version N (with no other metadata changes).
     * - TXN1 sees that another commit won, and needs to know whether to commit at version N+1 or
     *   fail. Using the `readPredicates` and resultant `readFiles`, TXN1 can see that none of its
     *   readFiles were changed by TXN2. Thus there are no logical conflicts and TXN1 can commit at
     *   table version N+1.

     * @return Files matching the given predicates.
