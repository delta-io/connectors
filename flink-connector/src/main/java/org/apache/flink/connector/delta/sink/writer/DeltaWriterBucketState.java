 * State of a {@link DeltaWriterBucket} that will become part of each application's

 * <p>
 * This class is partially inspired by
 * {@link org.apache.flink.connector.file.sink.writer.FileWriterBucketState}
 * but with some modifications like:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>removed snapshotting in-progress file's state because
 *       {@link org.apache.flink.connector.delta.sink.DeltaSink} is supposed to always roll part
 *       files on checkpoint so there is no need to recover any in-progress files' states
 *   <li>extends the state by adding application's unique identifier to guarantee the idempotent
 *       file writes and commits to the {@link io.delta.standalone.DeltaLog}
 * </ol>
