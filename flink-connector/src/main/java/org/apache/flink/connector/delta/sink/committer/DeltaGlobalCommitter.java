/**
 * A {@link GlobalCommitter} implementation for
 * {@link org.apache.flink.connector.delta.sink.DeltaSink}.
 * <p>
 * It commits written files to the DeltaLog and provides exactly once semantics by guaranteeing
 * idempotence behaviour of the commit phase. It means that when given the same set of
 * {@link DeltaCommittable} objects (that contain metadata about written files along with unique
 * identifier of the given Flink's job and checkpoint id) it will never commit them multiple times.
 * Such behaviour is achieved by constructing transactional id using mentioned app identifier and
 * checkpointId.
